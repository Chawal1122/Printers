			&emsp;  &emsp; &emsp;The impact printers take the help of force to push ink onto paper.
 			Instead of softly going through the process of putting ink,
			a plastic or metal piece is used to smack the ink ribbon onto the sheet, 
			which in turn helps in the formation of letters, numbers, or lines.

			Dot matrix printing, sometimes called impact matrix printing,
			is a computer printing process in which ink is applied to 
			a surface using a relatively low-resolution dot matrix for layout. 
			Dot matrix printers are a type of impact printer that prints using a fixed 
			number of pins or wires and typically use a print head that moves back and forth or
			in an up-and-down motion on the page and prints by impact, 
			striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper. 
			They were also known as serial dot matrix printers

			Daisy wheel printing is an impact printing technology invented 
			in 1970 by Andrew Gabo at Diablo Data Systems. 
			It uses interchangeable pre-formed type elements, each with 
			typically 96 glyphs, to generate high-quality output comparable to premium typewriters 
			such as the IBM Selectric, but two to three times faster. Daisy wheel 
			printing was used in electronic typewriters, word processors and computers from 1972. 
			The daisy wheel is so named because of its resemblance to the daisy flower.

			A line printer prints one entire line of text before advancing to another 
			line. Most early line printers were impact printers.
			Line printers are mostly associated with unit record equipment and the early days of 
			digital computing, but the technology is still in use. Print speeds of 600 lines per minute 
			(approximately 10 pages per minute) were achieved in the 1950s, later increasing to as much as 1200 lpm. 
			Line printers print a complete line at a time and have speeds in the range of 150 to 2500 lines per minute.
